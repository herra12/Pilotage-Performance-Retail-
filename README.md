# Retail Analytics Dashboard

## Objective
This project involves analyzing retail purchases with data modeling in **Google BigQuery** (fact and dimension tables), followed by connecting to **Power BI** to create interactive dashboards that track sales, analyze product performance, and optimize inventory management through Pareto analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Google BigQuery**: Data modeling and storage in fact and dimension tables.
- **Power BI**: Data visualization with interactive dashboards.
- **DAX**: Advanced calculations in Power BI to optimize performance.
- **SQL**: Data creation and management in BigQuery.
- **Excel**: Raw data source.

## Project Steps
1. **Data Modeling in BigQuery**: Extraction and preparation of the data.
2. **Power BI Dashboard Creation**: Visualization of KPIs (sales, overstock products, etc.).
3. **Product Performance Analysis**: Optimization of inventory and stock management.
4. **Forecasting Model Creation**: To predict product demand.

## Results
- Interactive dashboard to track sales and margins.
- Visual analysis of overstock products to optimize orders.
- Forecasting supply needs based on Pareto analysis.
